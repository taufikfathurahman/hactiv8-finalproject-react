# React Blog

React Blog is a single page application built with React as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). Too see it running, it requires to start the fake API application project [blog-api](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/blog-api).

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
